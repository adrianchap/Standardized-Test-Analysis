## SAT State Participation Analysis, 2017-2018
by Adrian Chapman

### Problem Statement

Increasingly, many colleges are adopting new policies to make standardized testing optional for admittance.  Despite this challenge, the College Review has found fertal ground for the SAT positioning it as a more useful alternative to federally required Common Core tests, which have no utility whatsoever for college applications.

This study aims to review state participation for the SAT over the past 3 years (2017-2019), and for the SAT's biggest compettetor, the ACTs. Specific reccomendations for investment and expansion opportunities as supported by the data are discussed.

### Analysis

Through EDA and Data Visualization, this study compares state participation in the SAT and ACT test from the years 2017 to 2019. While the ACT still has more states with 100% participation, the SAT has strong momentum in winning over previously ACT dominated states, and making strong inroads in states that have not made either the ACT or SAT a requirement yet.

### Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on the data exploration presented, there are 3 viable strategies that can be recommended for continued SAT expansion into states:

1. Don't be afraid to try to take over ACT dominated states.  The SAT turned Illinois and Colorado from 100% ACT to 100% SAT in 3 years.  Missouri has already dropped the ACT requirement, and Oklahoma has seen a 15% rise in SAT participation despite still having an ACT requirement.  These two states could be great targets for expansion.
2. Continue to capitalize on weakening ACT markets.  South Carolina has dropped 22% in ACT participation and SAT is close to becoming the preferred test.  Alaska has dropped 27%.  Missouri, Michigan and Hawaii also have double digit drops and could make excellent targets.
3. Follow through with the momentum already established.  In addition to Illinois and Colorado, SAT has also pushed West Virginia, Rhode Island and Florida to 100% participation in 3 years.  ACT only gained one state, Ohio, over the same period. The SAT can follow through with double digit positive participation growth in large markets such as Maryland, New York, New Jersey, California, and Georgia to find continued success.
